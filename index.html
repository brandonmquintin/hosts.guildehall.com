      <div class="signal__content">
        <p>Welcome. This site is for nonprofits and community groups who are ready to make money by leasing their property to the public as an event venue. Some may rent already, and are using GuildeHall to simplify and enhance a complex process; and some may be interested in starting, but are feeling overwhelmed about how to begin. Either way, you're in the right place. Here you'll learn about everything we can do to help your organization achieve financial success and stability as a GuildeHall Host.</p>

      </a>
      <div class="signal__content">
        <p>Your organization is an important part of the community. Whether you preserve local history, promote the arts, foster education, or provide public gathering space, your mission makes Virginia a better place to live. GuildeHall is here to support that mission by turning your existing property into a reliable, low-effort source of supplemental revenue.</p>
        <p>Many community organizations and nonprofits already maintain beautiful, event-ready spaces: historic homes, museum halls, conference rooms, gardens, lodges, auditoriums, etc. These spaces are cared for, paid for, and full of potential. GuildeHall ensures they also deliver value—at no cost to you. No fees; no subscriptions. (We take our cut from the Guest, and make sure you get every dollar you deserve. More on that later).</p>

        <p>If your organization already rents its space to the public, GuildeHall can streamline and strengthen that effort—automating key processes and expanding your reach to a wider audience of prospective Guests. We'll act as your de facto marketing manager, and our technology will lower friction so that Guests have far fewer reasons to shy away.</p>
        <p>If you have a property that you think could serve as a venue, and are ready for an opportunity to earn more cash, GuildeHall is here to help. When starting out, the process can appear intimidating—but we'll make it easy and be by your side every step of the way to becoming a Host. With GuildeHall, access to much-needed additional revenue is closer than ever before.</p>

      <div class="signal__content">
        <p>GuildeHall is an online marketplace where members of the public can browse and book event venues owned by local nonprofit and civil society organizations.</p>
        <p>Unlike other booking platforms, we do not serve commercial landlords or for-profit venue companies. Our platform is exclusively focused on helping mission-driven organizations earn additional revenue and expand their public engagement.</p>
        <p>We make it easy for people to find and book your space for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Weddings, reunions, and special celebrations</li>
          <li>Civic meetings and fundraisers</li>
          <li>Cultural or educational events</li>
          <li>Corporate off-sites, planning retreats, and more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All while supporting the causes that matter most to them.</p>

        <h2><span>04.</span> <strong>Free and easy</strong></h2>
      </a>
      <div class="signal__content">
        <p>There is no cost to participate in GuildeHall. You will never be asked to pay a fee, buy software, or subscribe to a platform. We charge a small 5% transaction fee to the Guest making the booking, which covers our operations, insurance integration, and customer support.</p>
        <p>In this initial pilot phase, we are limiting participation to only a dozen or so select properties across Central Virginia. If you are interested, now is the time to act, as space is limited.</p>

        <p>You won't need to learn a new system or manage an account. Our team will handle everything:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We create your listing</li>
          <li>We forward all inquiries and guest communication</li>
          <li>We process bookings and payments</li>

        <p>You retain full control over which bookings are approved and when your space is available. You hardly have to lift a finger. Our job is to bring the right Guests to your doorstep—and to make the process seamless for you.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Property photos (exterior, interior, and any relevant setup examples)</li>
          <li>Address and a reliable contact person for questions</li>
          <li>Rental rates, any booking fees, and security deposit requirements</li>
          <li>Capacity and square footage for each rental space</li>
          <li>Policies for food and beverage use</li>
          <li>Alcohol policy (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Restroom information (accessibility, number of stalls, etc.)</li>
          <li>Furniture included or available on site</li>
          <li>Parking details (onsite, street, public lots, etc.)</li>
          <li>A PDF of your standard rental agreement</li>
          <li>A brief organizational bio and mission statement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once we receive these, we'll build your profile page and coordinate any final custom details before going live.</p>

        <p>When you're listed as a Host on GuildeHall, Guests will have everything they need to decide if your venue is a good fit for their event. No worrying about constant backs-and-forths, Guests leading you on, or wasting your time.</p>
        <p>If they like what they see, they'll choose a day, time, and space (if applicable) from the calendar (which displays your real-time availability), and submit a booking request. Included with the request will be their answers to a variety of supplemental questions showing the type of event, number of guests, name of organization or individual making the booking, and more.</p>
        <p>We'll process the request and send it directly to the person within your organization tasked with overseeing bookings. You'll receive a phone call (or email, depending on how you prefer to be contacted) letting you know about the request and seeking your approval or disapproval. If a tour is required or requested, it'll happen at this point.</p>
        <p>If approved, we'll have the Guest sign a rental agreement, pay the full rental fee and security deposit, and acquire liability insurance. All documentation will be sent directly to you and all payments will be deposited into your bank account. No more multiple meetings signing paperwork; no more paper checks. More simplicity; more security; more peace-of-mind.</p>
        <p>After the event we'll refund (or withhold) the security deposit, and make sure your Guests leave a review. If there were any kinks along the way, we'll work them out here. At the end of the road, your organization will have more money at its disposal and will have heightened its presence in the local community: a win-win!</p>

        <h3>More money, less risk</h3>
        <p>Most organizations have event rental potential they're not taking full advantage of—not due to lack of interest, but due to limited time, staffing, or visibility. GuildeHall changes that. We bring Guests to your door, manage logistics, and make sure your space is used in a way that supports your mission. All without costing you anything.</p>

        <h3>Meet your new marketing manager</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges local venues face is lack of visibility. Sometimes, people simply don't know certain spaces exist or that they're available for rent. That's not the property owners' fault; small teams may not have the time, budget, or resources to market event space effectively.</p>
        <p>By participating in GuildeHall, it's as though you've added a dedicated marketing and booking manager to your team—at no cost. We list your venue alongside other community-focused spaces in a beautifully designed, easy-to-use site. Guests browsing for a venue in Virginia will find your property without needing to know about your organization in advance.</p>

        <h3>You're covered</h3>
        <p>Many organizations we've spoken to cite liability insurance as a key hurdle in their rental process. Most Guests don't know they need it. Those who do often don't know where to get it. That uncertainty stops events from moving forward.</p>
        <p>GuildeHall solves this. During checkout, Guests are automatically prompted to purchase affordable, event-specific liability coverage if they don't already have it. This takes the burden off your organization, ensures coverage is always in place, and removes a major barrier to booking.</p>

        <h3>Mission critical</h3>
        <p>Every rental through GuildeHall helps fund your organization's work. But more than that, it introduces your mission to new people. Your venue profile includes your organization's name, purpose, and the impact of rental proceeds. Guests learn who you are and what you do.</p>
        <p>Guests could become repeat visitors, volunteers, or even donors. Every booking is a chance to form a lasting connection with someone who may never have discovered you otherwise.</p>

        <h3>You have the power</h3>
        <p>You decide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which dates your space is available</li>
          <li>What types of events are acceptable</li>
          <li>How much you charge</li>
          <li>What rules apply</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You never have to accept a booking you're uncomfortable with. GuildeHall is designed to serve your needs—not the other way around.</p>
